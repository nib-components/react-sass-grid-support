# @nib-components/react-sass-grid-support

Make [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) support the attributes (`g-xs`, `g-sm`, `g-md`, `g-lg`, `g-xl`) for our pre-compiled [sass-grid](https://github.com/nib-styles/sass-grid).

---

The current version of React doesn't support custom attributes on elements without the `data-` prefix. 
The React developers [plan on removing this restriction](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/140#issuecomment-67029693) but haven't got round to it yet because of complications.
